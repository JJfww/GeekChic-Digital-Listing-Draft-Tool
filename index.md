# GeekChic Listing Draft Tool

## What this is
A private, seller-only tool I run for **my own shop** to create and update **DRAFT** digital listings using the  :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} Open API v3 (OAuth 2.0; listings write scope).

## Why I need the API
I sell digital downloads and create many similar listings. This tool reduces manual entry and formatting errors by generating drafts from my local product catalog.

## What it does (draft-only)
- Creates new **draft** listings and updates existing **draft** listings
- Fills listing content: title, description, tags, price, and section
- Uploads and assigns listing mockup and digital files to the draft
- **Never publishes** listings — I manually review and activate drafts in Etsy
- I also manually add/verify any other applicable attributes before publishing (when applicable)

## Data and users
- **Not offered to the public** (single user: me)
- Does **not** read or store buyer data, messages, or orders
- Only uses my own listing content and the authorization needed to access my seller account
