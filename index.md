Private seller-only tool I run for my own shop to create and update DRAFT digital listings via Etsy Open API v3 (OAuth 2.0, listings write scope). It fills titles/descriptions/tags/price/sections from my local product catalog and uploads/assigns images/files to the draft. It never publishes listings; I manually review and activate in Etsy, and add other attributes when applicable. No buyer data is read or stored; not offered to the public.
