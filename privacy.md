# Privacy Policy — GeekChic Listing Draft Tool

**Last updated:** February 20, 2026

## Summary
GeekChic Listing Draft Tool is a private, seller-only tool used to create and update **draft** listings for my own shop. It is not offered to the public.

## Information the tool uses
The tool uses and/or transmits only what is needed to create and update listing drafts, such as:
- Listing content I provide (titles, descriptions, tags, prices, sections)
- Listing media I provide (images and digital files intended for the listing including mockups and a promo video)
- Authorization credentials (OAuth access tokens) for my own seller account

## Information the tool does not collect
The tool does **not** access, collect, or store:
- Buyer personal information
- Orders, payments, or billing details
- Messages
- Shipping addresses
- Marketing lists

## How information is stored
- Any data stored by the tool is limited to what I need for my own workflow (e.g., my product catalog data and draft metadata).
- OAuth tokens, if stored, are kept private and used only to access my own seller account.

## Sharing
I do not sell or share information collected or used by this tool with third parties. Information is only used to support my own listing draft workflow.

## Security
I take reasonable steps to protect stored information (e.g., limiting access to my own devices/accounts and avoiding sharing credentials).

## Your choices
Because this tool is private and used only by me, there are no end-user accounts or public sign-ups.
